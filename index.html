       <h1>The Bike Incident</h1>

       <p>I'm an only child and I grew up very sheltered and over-protected by my parents. Sure, I missed out on a lot as a kid, and didn't have much freedom, but that only made for funny memories. Like the time I went bike-riding with my childhood best friend.</p>

       <p>I was about 8 or 9 years old, and I had just learned how to ride a bike (read: I sucked at riding a bike). One day, my childhood best friend, who lived around the corner from me, had asked me to go bike-riding with her and her little brother at the middle school parking lot. Of course, I was amped to go, but my overprotective mother had her reservations about it. What if I got hurt? Kidnapped? Abducted by aliens? You never know! </p>

       <p>I begged and pleaded for her to let me go have fun, so she finally agreed...under one condition: she had to drive me there. Now, that may not sound too extreme, but the school was down the street from my house. Literally, a 5 minute walk. I could've walked my bike there myself. *shrugs* Before I could go, my mom had one last condition: the dreaded fanny pack. </p>

       <p>To ensure my safety, my mom required I wear a fanny pack, in case of emergency. And as clumsy as I was, there WOULD be an emergency. The fanny pack included the following: <ul><li>Band-Aids (for the inevitable accident)</li>
        <li>Neosporin (obviously)</li>
        <li>Napkins (to blot the inevitable blood)</li>
        <li>Mom's cell phone (to call 911, for whatever reason)</li>
        <li>Candy (why not?)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

    <p>So, Mom threw my bike into her trunk and drove me (less than 1 minute away) to the middle school to meet my friends. As soon as we arrived, she told my friends, "Don't be doing no tricks! He can't ride that good!"  I cringed. "Why would she say that," I thought. My friends looked at me with pity. She reminded me to use her cell phone in case of emergency, and then went back home. I shook off the embarrassment and started riding my bike. Despite everything that led up to this moment, I was having fun. We rode our bikes around the parking lot for about 20 minutes. My friends started riding in a small circle, so I thought, "Hey! I can do that too!" Newsflash: I couldn't. One wrong turn and I fell off my bike and skinned my knee. </p>

    <p>I had no choice but to pull out the first aid kit and apply the Neosporin and band-aid. After that, I had had enough for the day, so I decided it best I go home. LOL. I told my friends bye and walked my bike back home.</p>

    <p>To this day, my Mom and I still laugh at that story!</p>
